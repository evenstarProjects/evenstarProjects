## Hi there! 😄

## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## I am an animal lover🐶, gamer🎮, and Lord of the Rings nerd 🧝🧙‍♂️💍🥔.
## I am also a qualified Personal Trainer🏋️‍♀️ and Actor🎭.

## I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, through MadLab's 'Intro to Web Development' course. 💻
## After finishing this course, I would like to move towards Front End Development.
## I plan to learn C++, Java, and C# next. I'd love to get into Video Game Development and Motion Capture📽️🎙️.
## I am Motion Capture trained as an Actor, but I'd love to see the other side of the development!

## Fun Fact: In my free time, I learn to fight people with Longswords⚔️, Fencing Swords🤺, Axes🪓, Staffs, Knives🔪, and Hand-to-Hand🤜✋ (Stage Combat student).

## I just enjoy learning! So I'd love to join in on any collaborative projects and learn from people around me who are further along their coding journey!👩‍🎓📚📓

## ✨I look forward to showing the magic of learning by making this profile look cooler and cooler 😎✨
