Favourite Lord of the Rings Quote -

## Coding Journey:
I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, through MadLab's 'Intro to Web Development' course. 💻
After finishing this course, I would like to move towards Front End Development.
I plan to learn C++, Java, and C# next. I'd love to explore Video Game Development and Motion Capture📽️🎙️.
I have Motion Capture training as an Actor, but I'd love to experience the other side of the development!

__In Essence...__
I just enjoy learning! So I'd love to join in on any collaborative projects and learn from people around me who are further along their coding journey!👩‍🎓📚📓

### ✨I look forward to showing the magic of learning by making this profile look cooler and cooler 😎✨
