### Coding Journey:
I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on MadLab's 'Intro to Web Development' course. 💻
I completed further further courses with MadLab, including Python, and Game Design using GB Studio.
I would like to move towards Front End Development.
I would love to learn C++, Java, and C# next. I'd love to explore Video Game Development and Motion Capture📽️🎙️.
I have Motion Capture training as an Actor, but I'd love to experience the other side of the development!

__In Essence...__  
I just enjoy learning! So I'd love to join in on any collaborative projects and learn from people around me who are further along their coding journey!👩‍🎓📚📓
